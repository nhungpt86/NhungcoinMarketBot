## Installation:
1. Install necessary requirements using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Rename `config_template.json` to `config.json`
3. Enter your discord token inside the token variable in `config.json`
4. Enter coinmarketcal id and secret in their respective fields<br>
(You can create and find both from here https://api.coinmarketcal.com/)
5. Run with ```python bot.py``` or ```python3 bot.py```

You're also given the option to change the command prefix as you see fit inside of the config.json.

If you want to use the :small_green_triangle: emoji, I've uploaded it in the emoji folder. To use it for your bot, have a server with the emoji uploaded to it (while also naming it small_green_triangle) and edit the id of the `SMALL_GREEN_TRIANGLE` variable at the top of `coin_market.py` to the emoji ID of your emoji.
## Commands:
This bot has commands to look up cryptocurrencies, subscribe to live updates, create crypto price alerts for the user, and many more.

[See examples of the commands here](https://github.com/kodycode/CoinMarketDiscordBot/wiki/Examples)

[See wiki page here](https://github.com/kodycode/CoinMarketDiscordBot/wiki/Command-Page) or type ```$help```.
